### State Descriptions

| State | Description | Triggers |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Stopped** | No server process running. Port is available. No runtime.json. | Initial state, after clean stop |
| **Starting** | Server is being initialized. Spawning process, waiting for health. | `brainpalace start` command |
| **Running** | Server is operational. Accepting requests. Health check passes. | Health check success |
| **Stopping** | Graceful shutdown in progress. SIGTERM sent. | `brainpalace stop`, SIGTERM |
| **ForceKilling** | Forced shutdown. SIGKILL sent after timeout. | `--force` flag, SIGTERM timeout |
| **Failed** | Error state. Stale files may exist. | Crash, timeout, unhandled error |

### Transitions

1. **Stopped -> Starting**
   - Trigger: `brainpalace start` command
   - Actions:
     - Resolve project root (git root or marker detection)
     - Read config.json from state directory
     - Find available port (auto-detect or explicit)
     - Spawn uvicorn subprocess with environment variables
     - Write runtime.json with PID, port, base_url
     - Poll health endpoint until ready

2. **Starting -> Running**
   - Trigger: Health check returns 200 OK
   - Timeout: 30 seconds (configurable with `--timeout`)
   - Actions:
     - Update global registry at `~/.doc-serve/registry.json`
     - Display success message with URL

3. **Starting -> Failed**
   - Trigger: Health check timeout or process crash
   - Actions:
     - Kill orphaned process (if still alive)
     - Delete runtime.json
     - Log error message

4. **Running -> Stopping**
   - Trigger: `brainpalace stop` or SIGTERM signal
   - Actions:
     - Send SIGTERM to process
     - Wait for graceful shutdown (10 seconds default)

5. **Stopping -> Stopped**
   - Trigger: Process exits cleanly
   - Actions:
     - Delete runtime.json, lock file, PID file
     - Remove from global registry

6. **Stopping -> ForceKilling**
   - Trigger: Graceful timeout with `--force` flag
   - Actions:
     - Send SIGKILL to process

7. **ForceKilling -> Stopped**
   - Trigger: Process killed
   - Actions:
     - Force cleanup all state files

### State Descriptions

| State | HTTP Status | Meaning |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Initializing** | 200 (pending) | Server starting up |
| **Healthy** | 200 | All systems operational |
| **Indexing** | 200 | Background indexing active |
| **Degraded** | 200 | Partial functionality |
| **Unhealthy** | 500/503 | Critical failure |

### Health Check Response

```json
{
    "status": "healthy",
    "message": "Server is running and ready for queries",

|--------|-----------|--------------|
| `healthy` | All ready, no errors | Full query support |
| `indexing` | Active indexing job | Queries blocked (503) |
| `degraded` | Partial functionality | Some query modes fail |
| `unhealthy` | Critical failure | All queries fail |

### Degraded Conditions

1. **Vector Store Not Initialized**

   - Impact: All query modes fail
   - Resolution: Run indexing

2. **Last Indexing Failed**
   - Message: "Last indexing failed: {error}"

**Endpoint**: `GET /health/`

**Response Model**: `HealthStatus`

```python
class HealthStatus(BaseModel):
    status: Literal["healthy", "indexing", "degraded", "unhealthy"]
