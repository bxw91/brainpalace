"""Chunk-ID uniqueness regression tests.

Regression coverage for issue #141: multi-part documents (e.g. PDF pages)
share the same `LoadedDocument.source`, so chunk IDs derived solely from
`(source, idx)` collide and storage silently overwrites them.

These tests pin the contract that:

  1. Two `LoadedDocument` instances sharing `source` but distinguished by a
     `page_label` metadata field MUST produce disjoint chunk IDs.
  2. A `LoadedDocument` without page metadata MUST keep its existing
     `(source, idx)` ID derivation (backwards compatibility — re-indexing
     existing corpora must not churn).
  3. Chunking the same document twice MUST yield identical chunk IDs
     (stability across re-indexing — the upsert contract).
