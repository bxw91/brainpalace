"""Regression test for issue #143 — zero-chunk diff must not fail the job.

When the manifest diff sees N "new" files that all chunk to zero (empty
placeholder ``.md`` files, scaffolding, etc.), the BM25 build must not
raise ``Please pass exactly one of index, nodes, or docstore.``. v9.6.0
silently no-oped here; v10.0.x regressed.
