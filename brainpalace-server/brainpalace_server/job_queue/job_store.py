    """Choose which recovered stale jobs to auto-reindex (D14).

    Picks at most one **document** job per folder and **excludes
    permanently-FAILED jobs**.

    A stale job is marked FAILED by ``_handle_stale_jobs`` only after its retry
    budget is exhausted. Re-enqueuing such a job mints a fresh ``retry_count=0``
    job for the same folder, which defeats the retry cap: a job that
    deterministically crashes the server on every run (e.g. a native segfault in
    the vector store while indexing a corrupt index) would loop forever instead
    of staying failed. Only jobs reset to PENDING — still under the retry cap —
    are eligible for re-enqueue.

    Non-document jobs are never replayed: ``reenqueue_from_record`` rebuilds an
    ``IndexRequest`` from the record, but a ``git_history`` record carries
    ``folder_path=<repo root>`` and the ``include_code`` field default (False),
    so replaying one runs a documents-only index over the whole project that
    evicts every code chunk as "deleted". The git boot-index is enqueued on
    every startup anyway, so a stale git job needs no replay.

        stale_jobs: Records returned by ``JobQueueStore.initialize()``.
