"""Chunk eviction service for incremental indexing.

This module provides the ChunkEvictionService which computes the diff
between the current filesystem state and the prior folder manifest,
deletes stale chunks from the storage backend, and returns the set of
files that need (re-)indexing.

Satisfies: EVICT-02, EVICT-03, EVICT-04, EVICT-05, EVICT-07.
