"""Regression tests for #150 — jobs CLI handling of structured progress.

The server emits a ``JobProgress`` dict (``percent_complete`` computed field
plus ``files_processed`` / ``files_total``); the v10.0.4 CLI assumed a float
and crashed with ``TypeError: unsupported format string passed to dict``.
These tests pin the v10.0.5 behaviour.
