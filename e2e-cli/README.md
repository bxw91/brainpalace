# E2E CLI Test Harness

End-to-end testing harness for BrainPalace plugin commands through CLI adapters. Tests the full workflow from initialization to search and cleanup using headless CLI invocation.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run all scenarios with the Claude Code adapter
task e2e-cli

# Or directly
./e2e-cli/run.sh
```

## Prerequisites

- BrainPalace server dependencies installed (`cd brainpalace-server && poetry install`)
- `claude` CLI installed and configured (for Claude adapter)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variables set

## Usage

```bash
# Run all scenarios
./e2e-cli/run.sh

# Run with a specific adapter
./e2e-cli/run.sh --adapter claude

# Run a single scenario
./e2e-cli/run.sh --scenario search-hybrid

# List available scenarios
./e2e-cli/run.sh --list

# Dry run (show what would execute)
./e2e-cli/run.sh --dry-run

# Keep all workspaces (even passing ones)
./e2e-cli/run.sh --keep
```

| 91 | negative-bad-path | Index nonexistent path | Yes |
| 92 | negative-empty-query | Search with missing query | Yes |

## Reports

After each run, reports are generated in `e2e_workdir/<run-id>/`:

- `report.json` — Machine-readable results
- `report.md` — Markdown summary for CI artifacts
- Terminal table — Printed to stdout

## Adding an Adapter

Create a new file in `adapters/<name>.sh` that exports these functions:

```bash
adapter_name()           # Return adapter name (e.g., "opencode")
adapter_available()      # Return 0 if CLI is installed
adapter_version()        # Print CLI version
adapter_supports_hooks() # Return 0 if adapter supports hooks
adapter_invoke()         # Run a command through the CLI
adapter_setup()          # Prepare workspace for this adapter
adapter_teardown()       # Clean up adapter-specific resources
```

## Adding a Scenario

Create a new `.sh` file in `scenarios/` with a numeric prefix for ordering:

```bash
scenario_name()           # Return scenario name
scenario_requires_hooks() # Return 0 if hooks are needed
scenario_requires_server()# Return 0 if server is needed
scenario_run()            # Execute the test (return 0=pass, 1=fail)
```

Use assertion helpers from `lib/harness.sh`:
- `assert_success "label" command args...`
- `assert_failure "label" command args...`
- `echo "$data" | assert_contains "label" "substring"`
- `echo "$data" | assert_matches "label" "regex"`
- `echo "$json" | assert_json "label" ".field" "expected"`
- `assert_gt "label" "$actual" "$threshold"`

## Workspace Isolation

Each scenario runs in an isolated workspace under `e2e_workdir/<run-id>/<adapter>/<scenario>/`. On success, only the disposable `project/` tree is cleaned up; logs, reports, and `cleanup/` helpers remain in place. On failure, the entire scenario workspace is preserved for debugging.

## Runtime Parity Harness

Runtime parity phases reuse the existing `e2e-cli/` harness instead of creating a
second framework.

- Checked-in fixture template: `e2e-cli/fixtures/runtime-project-template/`
- Disposable runtime copy: `e2e_workdir/<run-id>/<adapter>/<scenario>/<runtime>-runtime/project/`
- Runtime helper directories: `e2e_workdir/<run-id>/<adapter>/<scenario>/<runtime>-runtime/{cleanup,logs}/`
- Allowed install shape: `brainpalace install-agent --agent <runtime> --project --path <workspace> --json`
- Success cleanup removes only the disposable `project/` copy and keeps scenario
  logs plus future status artifacts in the scenario root
- Failure cleanup preserves the repo-owned scenario root for debugging and must
  never mutate checked-in fixture sources or user-global runtime directories

## OpenCode Parity Guard

OpenCode now defaults to the user's global runtime path, so the parity harness intentionally keeps every install scoped to a disposable `.opencode/` workspace. The helper in `e2e-cli/lib/runtime_parity.sh` ensures `--agent opencode --project --path <workspace>` is enforced, snapshots the real `~/.config/opencode` tree, and flags any mutation as `global_path_mutated`. The regression guard lives at `e2e-cli/tests/test_opencode_scope_guard.sh`.

## Runtime Verification Contract

Runtime parity execution verifies installs in this exact order before any real headless runtime call:

1. Structure check: confirm the expected project-local target directory exists under `e2e_workdir/` and the runtime-specific root has `logs/`.
2. Install/file + JSON validation: confirm the installer JSON resolves `target_dir` to the expected project-local path.
3. Dry runtime probe: run a runtime-specific probe command that must emit valid JSON.

Failures always produce both:

- `logs/failure.log` in the runtime-specific workspace
- A machine-readable JSON payload with `runtime`, `status`, `error_type`, `details`, `remediation`, and `workspace`

The current shared failure types are `missing_cli`, `install_verification_failed`, `malformed_json`, `forbidden_global_path`, and `global_path_mutated`.

## CI Integration

The harness runs nightly via `.github/workflows/e2e-nightly.yml`:
- Schedule: 6:00 AM UTC daily
- Can be triggered manually via `workflow_dispatch`
- Artifacts uploaded on failure
- Advisory only (not a required check)

## Cost

Each full run makes real `claude -p` API calls. Estimated cost: $0.50-2.00 per run depending on scenario count and response length.
